    "## 1. Why Secure Credential Management Matters in ML/AI Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "- In production, storing plain-text credentials is unsafe; can lead to data breaches\n",
    "- Many industries require compliance (privacy, auditing, responsible AI)\n",
    "- Proper secret management supports automation and reproducibility in cloud environments\n",

    "## 2. Introducing Azure Key Vault for Secret Management\n",
    "\n",
    "- Azure Key Vault stores secrets; manages keys and credentials centrally\n",
    "- Access controlled by Azure Active Directory and roles\n",
    "- Common secrets; database passwords, API tokens, ML model keys\n",

    "1. Follow template Python notebook; update vault and secret names\n",
    "2. Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential (works from Azure VMs or with service principal locally)\n",
    "3. Print secret (simulated password) using script\n",
    "4. Establish DB connection (simulate using sqlite3 if real database is not possible)\n",
    "5. Log and verify connection result; never print passwords to logs\n",

    "- **Test** your script using invalid credentials; verify access control works as expected\n",
    "- **Troubleshoot**; Check Key Vault access policies, role assignments, and environment config\n",
    "- **Best Practices**\n",
    "  - Never store credentials in code or git\n",
    "  - Use environment variables and Key Vault for secret management\n",
    "  - Rotate secrets regularly; monitor access logs\n",
    "  - Handle connection errors gracefully in scripts\n",
