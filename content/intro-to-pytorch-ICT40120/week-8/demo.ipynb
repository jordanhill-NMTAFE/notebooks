    "\n",
    "- Understand the purpose and structure of virtual networks and storage in Azure for ML workloads.\n",
    "- Design and deploy a simple virtual network to support AI resources and data movement.\n",
    "- Configure cloud storage, mount persistent datasets, and validate access from compute resources.\n",
    "- Test connectivity between VMs, storage, and (optionally) a database component in Azure.\n",

    "As ML Engineers and Cloud AI Developers, building robust, secure, and scalable networked environments is critical. This week we'll simulate the setup of a cloud infrastructure that supports high-performance machine learning workflows on Azure, focusing on networking and storageâ€”key areas that underpin modern ML production. You'll gain practical experience setting up the environment exactly as you might in a tech company or government data science team.\n",
