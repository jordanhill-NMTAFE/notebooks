    "**Industry and Practical Context**\n",
    "- Cloud computing is essential for scalable AI projects. GPU-powered VMs are industry-standard for training and inference in ML workflows.\n",
    "- Azure offers a variety of services. Understanding which one to select is key for cost, performance, and compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts**\n",
    "- Cloud deployment models; public cloud; hybrid; private; which one fits regulated AI workloads.\n",
    "- Virtual Machines (VMs); virtualized computers in the cloud; pay-as-you-go usage.\n",
    "- GPUs on Azure; enable high-performance computation for training deep learning models.\n",
