    "## 1. Introduction to Autoscaling and Automation in Cloud ML\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoscaling is a cloud computing feature that allows resources such as virtual machines to scale up or down automatically based on demand; this ensures both cost efficiency and performance in ML workflows that have variable workloads. Automation with scripting increases consistency, reproducibility, and reduces manual intervention, which is required in professional environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Demo; Setting up Autoscale on Azure GPU VMs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activity; What is Autoscale?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Autoscale automatically adjusts the number of VM instances depending on workload. In ML, this is critical when demand spikes during model training or inference.\n",
    "    - Benefits include reduced operational cost, improved resource utilization, and increased reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activity; Enable Autoscale on an Azure VM Scale Set\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Azure CLI to create a VM scale set with GPU support.\n",
    "2. Configure autoscale rules; for example, scale out when CPU or GPU utilization exceeds 70%, and scale in below 30%."

    "- List three reasons why autoscaling is beneficial for machine learning workloads.\n",
    "- Write a short Bash snippet for sending a notification if more than 3 VM instances are detected.\n",
    "- Summarize the difference between manual and automated resource management in the cloud workplace.\n",
    "- Describe one real-world scenario (from your studies or imagination) where autoscaling would directly prevent service interruption.\n",

    "## Summary and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Autoscaling and automation skills enable scalable, reliable ML/cloud deployments; they directly support industry needs and your upcoming assessments.\n",
