    "# Week 11 Workshop: Drafting Clear, Stakeholder-Focused EDA Reports\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Identify the key components of a clear, concise EDA report for industry stakeholders.\n",
    "- Practice synthesising data insights for actionable recommendations.\n",
    "- Develop technical communication skills and apply peer review feedback to improve report quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup and Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, you will work in teams to draft, review, and refine sample EDA report sections using open datasets. We will use Jupyter notebooks and Python tools from industry, focusing on how technical analysis is presented clearly for stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Stakeholders Need from EDA Reports\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focus on business or project outcomes; avoid unnecessary technical jargon.\n",
    "- Use clear visualizations to illustrate key findings.\n",
    "- Summarise actionable insights and recommendations.\n",
    "- Ensure documentation is reproducible and follows industry standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task;**\n",
    "- List two reasons why clear communication in data reports is important for AI or data science teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## EDA Report Structure Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong EDA report for stakeholders usually includes;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Title and executive summary; State dataset, purpose, and headline findings.\n",
    "- Data overview; Describe the data source, size, structure, and any limitations.\n",
    "- Methodology; Briefly explain the EDA approach (tools, cleaning steps, sampling).\n",
    "- Key findings with visuals; Use concise graphs or tables, highlight trends and anomalies.\n",
    "- Actionable recommendations; Suggest next steps or business actions based on findings.\n",
    "- Appendix; Include relevant code, data dictionaries, or technical details for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demonstration; Building an EDA Report Section\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a sample dataset ('penguins' from the seaborn library). Let's walk through preparing a simple visualization and summary for a non-technical stakeholder."

    "## Best Practices for Stakeholder-Focused Writing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lead with findings; explain why they matter for business or project goals.\n",
    "- Use visuals and summaries, not raw code or complex stats outputs.\n",
    "- Document sources and methods for reproducibility.\n",
