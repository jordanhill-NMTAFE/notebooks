    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup and Week Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Review the importance of data literacy and reliable open data sources\n",
    "- Gain hands-on experience accessing, exploring, and evaluating datasets from UCI, Kaggle, LAION, and HuggingFace Datasets repositories\n",
    "- Build foundational skills for working with real datasets in modern AI and data science projects\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recap of Week 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- Last week introduced the role of data in AI and the importance of open datasets such as LAION-5B and COCO\n",
    "- We discussed how big data enables learning and innovation in machine learning and AI\n",
    "- This week's session builds on that knowledge by teaching you how to find and select trustworthy datasets for AI work\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Literacy Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand data types; structured (tables), unstructured (text, images), and semi-structured (JSON, XML)\n",
    "- Recognize data formats; CSV, JSON, Parquet, TXT, Images\n",
    "- Know collection methods; manual entry, web scraping, sensors, API feeds, crowd-sourced\n",
    "- Evaluate reliability; source reputation, documentation quality, update frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Open Data Repositories (Industry Context)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**; Historical and widely-used datasets for benchmarking, education, small-scale ML projects\n",
    "- **Kaggle Datasets**; Diverse, community-shared datasets with active discussion, often linked to competitions and real-world scenarios\n",
    "- **LAION (Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network)**; Gigantic datasets (billions of records/images), designed for scalable AI. Example: LAION-5B (image-text pairs for training advanced AI models)\n",
    "- **HuggingFace Datasets**; Modern, programmatically accessible, with built-in dataset cards, tags, and versioning. Used extensively in NLP and deep learning workflows\n",

    "## Guided Repository Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. UCI Machine Learning Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visit https;//archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php\n",
    "- Browse datasets; note simple documentation (e.g., 'Iris', 'Adult', 'Wine')\n",
    "- Evaluate; Who created/hosts the dataset, what is documented, how often it is updated\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Kaggle Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to https;//www.kaggle.com/datasets\n",
    "- Sign up or access via Google/Microsoft account\n",
    "- Browse search bar or categories; examine dataset discussion/activity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. LAION Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access at https;//laion.ai\n",
    "- Review scale and open documentation; note technical requirements for handling data (often requires APIs, scripts, or cloud tools)\n",
    "- Discuss unique value for current AI (scale, richness, multi-modal data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. HuggingFace Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate to https;//huggingface.co/datasets\n",
    "- Filter by tags (e.g., 'images', 'text', 'language', 'size') and explore dataset cards for documentation, licensing, and intended uses\n",

    "\n",
    "- Always check dataset licenses before use in a project\n",

    "## Reflection and Assessment Prep\n",
    "\n",
    "- What characteristics make a dataset reliable and valuable for AI?\n",
    "- How does the method of data collection or repository affect your projectâ€™s results?\n",
    "- How will you justify your choice of dataset in assessment projects such as the research report and EDA?\n",

    "- Next week, we will cover data ethics and legal obligations when working with data\n",
    "- Suggested task; Select at least one dataset from this session that you could use for your future assessments. Begin summarising its documentation and intended use."
