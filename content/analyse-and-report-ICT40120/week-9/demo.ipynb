    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the structure and purpose of organisational data policies.\n",
    "- Identify key compliance requirements for data ethics and privacy.\n",
    "- Critically review a sample data policy; spot risks and propose improvements.\n",
    "- Connect industry standards to practical policy assessment tasks.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction; Data Policies in Real-World AI/IT Contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "Organisations working with large datasets must have data policies that outline how data is collected, processed, stored, and shared. These policies ensure compliance with laws, industry standards, and ethical guidelines, particularly important in AI and data science workplaces where sensitive or large-scale data is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Data policies support responsible data management and ethical AI.\n",
    "- Failure to comply can result in legal risks, reputational damage, or project failures.\n",
    "- Policies should align with industry best practices and relevant data protection regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Activity; Reading and Understanding a Sample Data Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "Read the simplified data policy extract below. Annotate key elements related to;\n",
    "- Data collection practices\n",
    "- Ethical use of data\n",
    "- Privacy and security measures\n",
    "- Data documentation and versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Data Policy Extract**\n",
    "> The organisation collects only data required for project objectives. All sensitive or personal data must be anonymised prior to analysis. The Data Science Team uses version control for datasets. Data access is restricted and logged. Any sharing of data requires manager approval and must follow documented procedures. All team members must complete annual ethics and privacy training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "- What strengths do you see in this policy?\n",
    "- Can you spot any missing or unclear areas relevant to AI/data projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Practical Exercise; Identify Policy Gaps and Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "- List any potential risks or compliance gaps based on the sample policy.\n",
    "    - Consider organisational AI use cases; sensitive data; external data sources; data documentation.\n",
    "- Document your findings in bullet points."
