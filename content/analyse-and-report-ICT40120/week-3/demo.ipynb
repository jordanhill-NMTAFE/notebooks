    "# Week 3 Demo; Ethical Dilemmas; Case Study Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup and Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Welcome and outline today’s focus; Building ethical awareness in handling open datasets used in AI.\n",
    "- Review key concepts from last week; Importance of reliable data sources in AI; Connect to the need for ethical/legal compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand basic data ethics principles and relevant legal frameworks for AI and data science.\n",
    "- Identify legal risks and ethical dilemmas common in large open datasets.\n",
    "- Develop practical skills for group analysis and decision-making on real-world scenarios in data ethics.\n",

    "## Part 1; Foundations of Data Ethics and Legal Compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown Cell  \n",
    "- Data ethics includes principles like privacy, fairness, accountability, and transparency; These guide responsible AI development.\n",
    "- Legal obligations for data handling often include laws such as GDPR, Australian Privacy Act, and codes of practice for data use.\n",
    "- Organisations must comply with regulations and also self-regulate using best-practice guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Group Discussion Prompt  \n",
    "- What are examples of laws or codes you may have heard of that impact how data is collected and used?  \n",
    "- Why is it important to think about ethics as well as compliance in AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2; Industry Case Study Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown Cell  \n",
    "- In industry, teams often work with massive open datasets (e.g. LAION-5B, COCO) where ethical and legal issues can arise; For example, collecting images from the internet without explicit consent, or data containing personal information.\n",
    "- Real-world datasets sometimes have hidden risks; e.g., inclusion of sensitive data, copyright concerns, or potential biases that may harm particular groups.\n",
    "- Today you will work in small groups on case studies to identify risks and propose solutions.\n",

    "### Case Study 1; Consent and Privacy in Open Image Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown Cell  \n",
    "- Scenario; A team is using a large, web-scraped dataset (like LAION-5B) to train an image recognition model; Some images appear to contain private individuals in public and private spaces; The dataset does not have explicit user consent.\n",
    "- Discuss in groups;  \n",
    "  - What are the major ethical and legal risks?  \n",
    "  - What steps could the team take to reduce harm and ensure compliance?\n",
    "- Each group shares their key points with the class.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case Study 2; Bias and Fairness in Dataset Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown Cell  \n",
    "- Scenario; A dataset from Kaggle is being repurposed to build an AI model for job application screening; Analysis reveals an over-representation of data from one gender and one geographic region.\n",
    "- Discuss in groups;  \n",
    "  - What are the potential impacts of bias in this dataset?  \n",
    "  - What ethical principles are being challenged?\n",
    "  - Propose steps for improving dataset fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hands-On Practical; Identifying Sensitive Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown Cell  \n",
    "- In many datasets, identifying and documenting “sensitive attributes” is part of ethical data handling.\n",
    "- Try this sample code to explore a small sample dataset and flag potential sensitive fields."
