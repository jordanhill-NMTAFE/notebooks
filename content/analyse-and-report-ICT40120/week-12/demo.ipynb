    "# Week 12 Workshop: Constructing and Documenting a Reproducible EDA Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Identify essential components of a transparent, reproducible EDA pipeline using Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "- Implement a simple, industry-standard data processing workflow for an open dataset\n",

    "\n",
    "This workshop prepares you to construct a transparent data analysis pipeline using Jupyter Notebooks. You will use open datasets and industry tools, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and markdown documentation. Reproducibility and documentation are key skills for AI/data science project submissions and real-world workflows.\n",

    "- Install required packages using pip; example; `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`\n",
    "- Download a small open dataset (e.g., UCI Iris or Titanic dataset) for demonstration\n",
    "- Set up your Jupyter Notebook with a clear title, author block, and project metadata at the top"
