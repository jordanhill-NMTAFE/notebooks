    "- Understand the importance of peer review in professional data science workflows.\n",
    "- Review industry rubrics; focus on documentation, reproducibility, ethical considerations, clarity, and value of insights.\n",
    "- Recall that all projects must:\n",
    "    - Document dataset sourcing and preparation steps.\n",
    "    - Include clear code, markdown explanations, and reproducible workflows.\n",
    "    - Address ethical risks such as bias or privacy.\n",
    "    - Follow established data versioning and documentation practices.\n",

    "**Peer Review Checklist**\n",
    "- Is the dataset clearly described and sourced?\n",
    "- Are preprocessing and EDA steps fully documented?\n",
    "- Is the analysis (statistics, visualizations, or ML models) logically sequenced and reproducible?\n",
    "- Are key findings/decisions well explained?\n",
    "- Are ethical risks (e.g., bias, privacy) discussed and mitigation steps described?\n",
    "- Are all code, outputs, and versions clearly marked and up to industry standards?\n",
